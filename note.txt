Programming Notes

The text interpretation on the right is because the width of the browser is not enough.

 
1. Draw the chart when d3.3.5 verison is loaded
2. CHeck what version of D3 is used by builtfacechart function
3. D3.xml requires d3.v4, nvd3 requires d3.v3
4. The x and y range has abilities to fit with both version
5. Setup  three stages scripting importing first import d3.v4 for xml import svg.
6. Load d3.min.js with 3.5.2 version and then load NV.d3  because  NVD3 only works with d3 v3
7. CHanged from loading d3.v4 and d3.v3 async to all the code to v3 version with out async loading.
8. The hard challenge is that later loading the nvd3 visualization and the face vis all requires d3.v3
9. Change builtfacechart to v3 version
10. Add builtfacechart to callback/show bounding box part
11. Trying to draw happy and sad face in the chart. Figuring out why happyfaceSVG and sadfaceSVG are not visiable as global variable
12. Figured out 11. becasue they are declared as local variable during evaluation.
13. Connect builtfaceChart with data, using goodData and badData from the very beginning.
14.  Bulit a mockup builtfaceChart example on the first load without doing the ajax call to debug the face chart
